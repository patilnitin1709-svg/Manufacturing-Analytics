# Manufacturing Unit Dashboard Analysis

## 1️⃣ Business Problem

A manufacturing company faced challenges in monitoring production performance, quality control, and delivery efficiency across multiple departments.
Despite high production volume, management struggled to:

* Identify machines responsible for frequent product rejections.
* Track employee-wise productivity and rejection trends.
* Detect performance drops during specific months.
* Maintain consistent on-time delivery performance.
* Manage and visualize KPIs across different platforms effectively.

This project aims to build an integrated set of dashboards to uncover bottlenecks and improve operational visibility using Excel, Power BI, and Tableau.

## 2️⃣ Goals of the Project

To design and develop three analytical dashboards that transform raw manufacturing data into interactive visual insights for decision‑making.

### Objectives

* Track total manufactured, rejected, processed, and wastage quantities.
* Highlight machine-wise and employee-wise performance.
* Detect monthly production anomalies.
* Compare department-wise efficiency and rejection trends.
* Evaluate on-time delivery metrics.

### ⚙️ Dashboard Breakdown

#### Excel Dashboard

**Purpose:** Provide a quick, data‑centric summary of overall production performance.

**Charts Used:**

* Bar Chart: Department-wise Manufactured & Rejected Qty
* Line Chart: Production vs Rejection trend over time
* Pie Chart: Employee-wise rejection distribution
* Card Visuals: Key KPIs (Total Qty, Wastage, Processed, Rejection %)

**Why These Charts:** To make data easily comparable and highlight rejection spikes across employees and machines.

**Key Findings:**

* Total Production: 49.79 M units
* Rejection Rate: 0.98%
* Machines MC027 & MC026 show higher rejection trends.

---

#### Power BI Dashboard

**Purpose:** Deliver interactive analysis with drill-downs and dynamic filtering.

**Charts Used:**

* Donut Chart: Employee-wise rejections
* Clustered Column Chart: Monthly Manufactured vs Rejected Qty
* Line Chart: Month-over-Month (MoM) variance analysis
* Card Tiles: Total Work Orders, Active Machines

**Insights & Performance Gaps:**

* Consistent overall performance but visible dips in February & October.
* Rejection rates stable but certain machines require preventive maintenance.
* Department comparison shows Footwear leads in production output.

---

#### Tableau Dashboard

**Purpose:** Present an intuitive, visually clean view for exploring rejections and productivity.

**Charts Used:**

* Bubble Chart: Department-wise rejection visualization
* Bar Graph: Machine-wise rejection rates
* Dual-Axis Line Chart: Production vs Rejection comparison
* KPI Cards: Total Manufactured, Rejected, Processed, and Wastage

**Why Tableau:** Allows seamless filtering, real-time updates, and visual storytelling for decision-makers.

**Findings:**

* Total Rejected Qty: 491.02 K units
* Average Processed Qty: 6 K units
* Delivery performance distributed equally across months.

---

## 3️⃣ Business Impact & Insights

**Operational Efficiency:**

* Maintained < 1% rejection rate across all departments.
* Identified top underperforming machines for maintenance scheduling.

**Productivity Optimization:**

* Recognized seasonal dips allowing proactive resource allocation.
* Balanced employee performance verified across production lines.

**Delivery & Quality:**

* Current on-time delivery: 33%, with potential improvement to 50%+ with process alignment.

**Strategic Outcomes:**

* Enable management to make faster, data-driven decisions.
* Enhanced production visibility and reduced quality variation.
* Strong foundation for implementing Lean Manufacturing and Six Sigma initiatives.
